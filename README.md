XNAT Vagrant
==============================

------------------------------

## Quick-Start

Make sure you have Vagrant, Git, and VirtualBox installed on your computer, then run `./setup.sh`
(or `setup.bat` on Windows) from this folder to build an XNAT virtual machine for testing or development.
Optionally, you can run the setup script in any preset configuration folder (in subfolders of the 'configs' folder).

## Info

There are multiple configuration options to choose from for setting up your XNAT Vagrant VM.
These are in the 'configs' folder - please refer to the README files in the respective folders
for more information regarding each config.

## General Setup

Before you run the setup script, you'll need to have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) installed on your host machine.
